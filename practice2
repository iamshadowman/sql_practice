-- PRACTICE 2

CREATE TABLE STATION(
  ID INT PRIMARY KEY,
  CITY VARCHAR(21),
  STATE VARCHAR(2),
  LAT_N INT,
  LONG_E INT
);

INSERT INTO STATION
(ID,CITY,STATE,LAT_N,LONG_E)
VALUES
(1,"KOLKATA","WB",22,88),
(2,"MUMBAI","MH",23,79),
(3,"DELHI","DH",26,82),
(4,"CHENNAI","TN",18,84),
(5,"KOLKATA","WB",22,87),
(6,"PUNE","WB",23,80);

SELECT * FROM STATION;

-- 1. Query a list of CITY and STATE from the STATION table.
SELECT CITY, STATE FROM STATION;

-- 2. Query a list of CITY names from STATION for cities that have an even ID number. 
-- Print the results in any order, but exclude duplicates from the answer.
SELECT ID, CITY FROM STATION
WHERE ID%2=0;

-- 3. Find the difference between the total number of CITY entries in the table and the number of distinct CITY entries in the table.
SELECT COUNT(CITY) - COUNT(DISTINCT CITY) AS DIFFERENCE 
FROM STATION;

-- 4. Query the two cities in STATION with the shortest and longest CITY names, as well as their respective lengths (i.e.: number of characters in the name).
-- If there is more than one smallest or largest city, choose the one that comes first when ordered alphabetically.
